        <h2>Event Facets</h2>

        The current event system is limited. New behaviors require writing new
        event types, and branching based on event type.

        <h3>Facets to the rescue!</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Facets are information and/or behaviors that can be attached to events</li>
            <li>All current behaviors have a facet</li>
            <li>All current event information is included in facets</li>
            <li>The 'Trace' object is now a facet</li>
            <li>Any event can have any facets</li>
        </ul>
