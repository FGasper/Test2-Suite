        <h2>What are plugins?</h2>

        <p>

        Plugins are modules that add or alter Test2 behaviors upon loading.

        <p>

        Plugins do not provide assertions.

        <p>

        Plugins are typically global in nature.

        <h2>Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail</h2>

        This, and its brother 'DieOnFail' provide a feature that Test::Builder
        was unable to provide despite significant demand.

        <p>

        This plugin will issue a Bail-Out event (end of testing) after the
        first failed assertion.

        <script class="code">
            use Test2::Bundle::Extended;
            use Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail;

            ok(1, "pass");
            ok(0, "fail"); # Bail-out issued after the assertion completes.

            ...; # No more code is run.
        </script>

        <ul>
            <li>Bail-Out happens just before ok() would return.</li>
            <li>Ok() has time to print out diagnostics before the bail-out.</li>
            <li>Test::Builder had no way to insure diagnostics were seen, but we do!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        This plugin will throw an exception after the first failed assertion.

        <script class="code">
            use Test2::Bundle::Extended;
            use Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail;

        </script>

        <ul>
            <li>Exception happens just before ok() would return.</li>
            <li>Ok() has time to print out diagnostics before the bail-out.</li>

        <h2>Test2::Plugin::ExitSummary</h2>

        This plugin provides some useful diagnostics in some failure cases.

        <p>

        Example, bad plan:

        <script class="code">
            use Test2::Tools::Basic;
            use Test2::Plugin::ExitSummary;
            
            plan 10;
            
            ok(1, "pass");
            exit 0;
        </script>

        <script class="output">
1..10
ok 1 - pass
# Did not follow plan: expected 10, ran 1.
        </script>

    </dd>

        Make test runs consistent, but still test random behavior.

        <p><br />

        <ul>
            <li>Sets random seed to the current date using srand("YYYYMMDD").</li>
            <li>Seed can be overriden with T2_RAND_SEED environment variable.</li>
            <li>Report the seed used in verbose mode, or when there is a test failure.</li>
            <li>Makes "random" behavior reproducable.</li>
            <li>Different days have different seeds, so you still verify changes from "random" numbers.</li>
