        <h2>What is Test2?</h2>

        Test2 is the new framework to replace Test::Builder.
        <p><br />

        <h3>Why?</h3>

        Test::Builder has outlived it's design. Too many tools are forced to
        work around the limitations it has.
        <p><br />

        <h3>What is going to happen to Test::Builder?</h3>

        Test::Builder has been modified to use Test2 under the hood.
        Test::Builder is not going away any time soon, but will play nicely
        with new tools.

        <h2>Benchmarks</h2>

        Test2 takes longer to load than Test::Builder. Test2 performs much
        better at run-time when compared to the old Test::Builder.
